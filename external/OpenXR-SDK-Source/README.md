# OpenXRâ„¢ Software Development Kit (SDK) Sources Project

This repository contains source code and build scripts for implementations
of the OpenXR loader, validation layers, and code samples.

The authoritative public repository is located at
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source/>.
It hosts the public Issue tracker, and accepts patches (Pull Requests) from the
general public.

If you want to simply write an application using OpenXR (the headers and loader),
with minimum dependencies,
see <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK/>.
That project is based on this one, but contains all generated files pre-generated,
removing the requirement for Python or build-time file generation,
and omits the samples, tests, and API layers, as they are not typically built as a part of an application.

## Note about `git blame`

We are tracking "bulk commits" in the `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file, for better
git blame output. Sadly it appears that web interfaces do not yet handle this
file, but you can if using the command line. See
[--ignore-revs-file docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt)
for details, and
[this blog post about ignore-revs](https://www.moxio.com/blog/43/ignoring-bulk-change-commits-with-git-blame)
for some useful usage details.
